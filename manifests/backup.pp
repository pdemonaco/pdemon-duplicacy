# This define handles the creation of a single backup schedule for the target
# repository / storage combination. The schedule is carried out via a cron
# object and a script which is stored in the $pref_dir/puppet/scripts/
#
# @summary Generates a script & schedules it given the specified parameters
#
# @example Full configuration for a given backup job.
#   duplicacy::backup { 'my-repo_daily': 
#     storage_name => 'default',
#     repo_path    => '/backup/dir',
#     pref_dir     => '/backup/dir/.duplicacy',
#     user         => 'root',
#     cron_entry   => {
#       hour       => '1',
#     },
#     backup_tag      => 'daily',
#     threads         => 4,
#     hash_mode       => true,
#     email_recipient => 'me@example.com',
#   }
#
# @example Minimal configuration
#   duplicacy::backup { 'my-repo_minimal':
#     storage_name => 'default',
#     repo_path    => '/backup/dir',
#     pref_dir     => '/backup/dir/.duplicacy',
#     user         => 'root',
#     cron_entry   => {
#       hour       => '*/6',
#     },
#   }
#
# @param storage_name [String]
#   Name of this particular storage backend as referenced by duplicacy for this
#   specific repository. Note that the backend named 'default' is the primary.
#
# @param repo_path [String]
#   Directory in which this particular repository resides on this machine. 
#
# @param user [String]
#   User to whom this repository belongs.
#
# @param pref_dir [Optional[String]]
#   Directory containing the duplicacy preferences for this repository.
#   Typically this is `${repo_path}/.duplicacy` however the application can
#   support alternate paths.
#
# @param cron_entry [Hash[String, Variant[String, Integer]]]
#   This parameter is used as an argument to the cron resource type, however,
#   several parameters are overridden directly. In particular, `user` and
#   `command` cannot be specified via remote arguments. For more detail see the
#   [puppet cron resource documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/types/cron.html).
# 
# @param backup_tag [Optional[String]]
#   This string will be set as the tag argument for each backup performed by
#   this job. These can be used by various duplicacy commands to filter to
#   specific snapshots.
#
# @param threads [Optional[Integer]]
#   Number of parallel execution threads which will be spawned for this backup.
#   Note that this defaults to 1 and should not be greater than the number of
#   available threads on the target machine.
#
# @param hash_mode [Optional[Boolean]]
#   Indicates whether a hash should be generated for each file to determine
#   whether a change has occured. The alternate approach simply uses file size
#   and modification timestamp. Note that this defaults to `false`.
#
# @param limit_rate [Optional[Integer]]
#   Maximum upload data rate in kilobytes per second (KB/s). Note that leaving
#   this unset implies no limit.
#
# @param email_recipient [Optional[String]]
#   If specified, the job log will be sent to the specified address.
#
#   @note This assumes email is configured and working on this system.
