# This type takes an ordered list of duplicity filter rules and inserts them
# into the filters file for a specific repository. For more detail on the filter
# rules see the [duplicacy
# wiki](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Include-Exclude-Patterns).
#
# @summary Creates a filters file for this repository.
#
# @example
#   duplicacy::filter { 'my-repo_filters':
#     $pref_dir       => '/my/repo/dir/.duplicacy',
#     $user           => 'me',
#     $rules => [ 
#       '+foo/bar/*',
#       '-*',
#     ],
#   }
#
# @param pref_dir [String]
#   Path to the '.duplicacy' directory in which this filters file should be
#   defined.
#
# @param user [String]
#   Who should own this file? Typically this is also who runs the backups and
#   owns the associated data.
#
# @param rules [Array]
#   An array of strings which each correspond to a line of the filter file. See
#   the https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Include-Exclude-Patterns
#   page for more detail.
